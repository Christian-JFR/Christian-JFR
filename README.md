# Hello, I'm Christian Florez,
## I'm a Self-Taught Full Stack Web Developer.

### As a self-taught full stack web developer, I've cultivated a deep passion for creating robust and efficient web applications.

Fueled by a passion for understanding the digital world, I embarked on a self-taught journey into full-stack web development. Countless hours later, I'm now adept at both front-end design with React and back-end functionality with Node.js. Crafting seamless user experiences and ensuring flawless functionality across the stack drives my dedication to continuous learning and best practices. Eager to tackle new challenges and push my boundaries, I'm excited to contribute my skills to impactful projects.
